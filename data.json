    "title": "About",
    "description": "<p>Ever since I was little, I can remember being curious about how my belongings (toys, gadgets, etc.) worked. My mom told me I would take apart my toys as a child just to put them back together. Along with that curiosity came a drive and desire to accomplish any task I put my mind to. I was relentless and believed that if I put the time and effort into something, I could accomplish anything. I knew no limit.</p><p>Fast forward to now, an adult with more resources and an income! Those skills and traits manifested into hobbies and side projects- refurbishing old bikes, screen-printing, embroidery… just to name a few. I enjoy testing my knowledge and limits to see what I am able to accomplish with the tools I possess, and this is not limited to the Software Development world.</p><p>Prior to being a Software Developer, I spent a decade working in retail, specifically fashion merchandising. At first it was simply a way to pay the bills, but after some time, I realized that merchandising itself is a large puzzle to be solved and it became a passion of mine. It’s equivalent to a game of Tetris, balancing colors, shapes, sizes, and textures to meet a list of requirements all in one space to aesthetically entice customers. I got paid to solve puzzles and be creative all at the same time? Felt like a dream.</p><p>But as with how life goes, we all transform and grow. I had hit a wall and no longer saw an upward trajectory for my career and decided that my growth was more important than remaining comfortable. I quit my job, one of the only consistent safety nets I had ever known and enrolled in a coding bootcamp. I’ll keep it short and simply state that they are not for the faint of heart, but I made it to the other side and entered into the world of Tech.</p><p>So here I am now, a Software Developer. I have new passions to add to my list, like creating web applications that are both functional and creative. I transferred my skills from clothing to code. Now I enjoy flexing the skills I learned into back-end and front-end development, both of which pose their own challenges and allow for different solutions, logically and aesthetically. It’s an unlikely parallel that has allowed me to visualize my future again.</p>"
